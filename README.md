On-screen calculator

- [ðŸ‘‰live demo](https://gazzaar.github.io/calculator)

### What I have leaerned in this project?

- Make mathematical operations
- Implement a nice gruvBox theme with css
- Get comfort with conditions and DOM methods

_NOTE_

- I did most of the functions by myslef, BUT, there is a chaining of operations
  that I couldn't figure it out myself so I looked for it in other repos,
  [This repo](https://github.com/ansarcodes/calculator) two or three function I refactor my code to the code in the repo, every thing else is by myself.
